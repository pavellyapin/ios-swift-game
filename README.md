# ios-swift-game
I created this game while completing a course at the University of Toronto. It's a basic Galaga game where you control a ship that shoots bullets and need to destory upcoming enemies. There are 3 levels of difficulty which determine the speed of the enemies coming and the speed of the player's gun bullets.
Used:
- SpriteKit
- CoreData
- UIKit
